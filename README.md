# 🚀 Simple Crew Builder

![Simple Crew Builder](images/simple-crew-builder.png)

**Simple Crew Builder** is a premium, open-source visual orchestrator for **CrewAI**. It empowers developers and AI enthusiasts to design, configure, and execute complex Multi-Agent systems through a stunning, intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." — Alan Kay

With the arrival of **v0.0.4**, Simple Crew Builder now features **Long-Term Memory** powered by **Neo4j**, enabling agents to learn and persist knowledge using advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

---

## ✨ Key Features (v0.0.4)

- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Orchestrate Agents, Tasks, and Crews using a powerful React Flow canvas.
- **🧠 Knowledge Base (RAG) Engine**: Use Neo4j as a vector store to give your agents "Long-Term Memory".
- **📁 Enterprise Code Parsing**: Upload entire repositories via `.zip` files. Our engine intelligently indexes codebases (React, Python, COBOL, etc.) while ignoring junk folders.
- **High-End UI**: Manage Knowledge Bases, upload documents, and watch agents "think" in real-time with a sleek, cyberpunk-inspired dashboard.
- **MCP Native**: Full support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and custom Python tools.
- **Zero Friction Deployment**: Ready to run with a single command — no environment configuration required for initial testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Zero Friction)

Experience the power of Simple Crew Builder in less than 2 minutes. Our production setup is designed to be **Plug & Play**.

### 1. Download the orchestration file
Save the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to a folder on your machine.

### 2. Launch the stack
Open your terminal in that folder and run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
*Note: No `.env` file is required for local testing. The system uses secure defaults for all internal databases.*

### 3. Access & Gear Up
Open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)** in your browser.

> [!TIP]
> **API Configuration:** Once the UI is open, go to `Settings -> Models` to add your **OPENAI_API_KEY**. No need to restart containers or edit system files!

graph TD
    User([User Browser]) -- port 8080 --> Frontend[Frontend - Nginx Proxy]
    Frontend -- /api/* --> Backend[Backend - FastAPI]
    Backend -- SQL --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    Backend -- Vector/Graph --> Neo4j[(Neo4j DB)]
```

### Advanced Deployment (Cloud/Production)
For production environments, you can customize credentials and security:
1. Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` to set strong passwords for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD`.
3. Restart the stack: `docker compose up -d`.
